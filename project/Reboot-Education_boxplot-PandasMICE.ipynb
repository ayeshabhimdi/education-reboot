These labels let ERS understand how schools are spending money and tailor their strategy recommendations to improve outcomes for students, teachers, and administrators.\n",

We know that FTE and Total Budget are document specific, i.e. a full-time employee and a higher paid employee would not have the same role, designation, operation status, etc as a part-time employee hired on a contract basis. We cannot impute them by taking a mean or median of the entire dataset. Hence, we need a special imputation method that can use as much information as possible from the other features (independent variables) to impute depending on each document (employee) feature. "
